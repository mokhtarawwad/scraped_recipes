For this assignment I scraped all the dessert recipes off of delish.com.
For a real treat, look at the Cookiedilla.

```{r}

setwd("/home/michael/Documents/College_Coursework/2018/spring/ds4100/assn-7/")
desserts <- read.csv("delish.com-recipe-details.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
desserts

```

Somehow import.io was unable to parse any of the Cook Time information
So I'm just gonna remove that column

```{r}
desserts$Cook.Time <- NULL
desserts

```

Then I'm gonna use Lubridate to clean up the Date Published field

```{r}
library(lubridate)
desserts$Date.Published <- strptime(desserts$Date.Published, format="%FT%T%z")

```

Lastly I really want to know which recipes have Chocolate in them.

```{r}
chocoholic <- function() {
  return(desserts[which(grepl("chocolate", desserts$Ingredients)), ])
}

chocoholic()

```
